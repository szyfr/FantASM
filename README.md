### Language: Assembly


An "emulator" for a non-existant system to play around with the idea of a modern-day 8-bit game system using assembly rather than a higher level language like lua.

The main purpose of this program is to enable me to create a much more simplified system than others such as the GB, C64, etc. where you need to worry about hardware limitations or quirks. This way i can focus on code and create fun projects.
